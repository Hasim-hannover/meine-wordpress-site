# Pillar Cornerstone Writer

Create cornerstone content that serves as the "start here" article for a pillar category and drives qualified inquiries.

## Write for This Audience

- Target founders, CEOs, CMOs, marketing leads, and sales leads in the Mittelstand.
- Prioritize decision relevance: revenue impact, efficiency, risk reduction, and scalability.
- Keep language clear and direct; avoid agency buzzwords and generic motivational phrases.

## Enforce This Output Structure

1. Provide an H1 with a strong business promise.
2. Open with a concrete pain point and cost of inaction.
3. Explain the strategic mechanism, not only tactics.
4. Add practical framework sections with H2/H3.
5. Include one visual concept description (diagram/graphic).
6. End with a strategic CTA (no hard sell).
7. Add SEO package: SEO title, meta description, slug, internal links.

## Apply These Content Rules

- Use short paragraphs (max 3-4 lines).
- Use bold for critical terms only.
- Use bullet points where scanning speed matters.
- Prefer concrete examples over abstract claims.
- Maintain one terminology set across the article.
- Keep claims realistic; avoid invented numbers.

## Align to Pillar Architecture

- Treat category page as hub; treat cornerstone article as "Hier starten".
- Link from cornerstone to cluster articles and one service page.
- Add reciprocal internal-link suggestions from cluster to cornerstone.

## Deliver This Final Package

1. SEO title (max 60 chars)
2. Meta description (max 155 chars)
3. URL slug (clean, lowercase, hyphen-separated)
4. Full article in Markdown
5. Suggested internal links (anchor text + target URL)
6. Optional image brief (alt text, title, caption)

## Quality Gate Before Finalizing

- Confirm audience fit (decision-maker level).
- Confirm pillar fit (Strategie/SEO/Tracking/CRO/Performance).
- Confirm consistent wording (no contradictions across sections).
- Confirm clear progression: Problem -> Mechanism -> Proof logic -> Action.
