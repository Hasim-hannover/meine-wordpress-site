# B2B Premium Design System & CRO Framework

Every design decision serves two masters: aesthetic excellence and measurable conversion.

## Shared Standards

For positioning, tone, copy direction, and brand colors: read `docs/standards/BRAND_AND_COPY.md`.

Project brand accent override: `#b46a3c` (copper, HSL `23 50% 47%`).

## Before You Code: Mandatory Pre-Flight

1. Read this SKILL.md completely.
2. Read the relevant reference file:
   - Components → `references/components.md`
   - Layout, spacing, color, typography → `references/design-tokens.md`
   - Animations, interactions → `references/motion.md`
3. Identify the conversion goal of the page/section.
4. Check the mode — Dark Mode is default.

## Design Philosophy: "Engineered Elegance"

Precision-meets-warmth. Not cold minimalism. Not loud maximalism.

Benchmarks: Linear (clean density), Vercel (typographic confidence), Stripe (layered depth), Raycast (refined dark UI).

**Core Principle**: Design should feel like it was built by engineers who care deeply about craft.

## Anti-Patterns (Hard Bans)

- Purple-gradient-on-white (the #1 AI slop pattern)
- Bright/saturated colors besides the accent
- Cold blue-gray backgrounds (hue 220+) — always warm neutrals (hue 25-35)
- Pure white (#fff) or pure black (#000) — always warm-tinted
- Inter/Roboto/Arial as primary typeface
- Card grids with identical border-radius and shadows
- Blue CTA buttons — CTAs use the accent color, always
- Gradient text on light backgrounds
- More than 2 font families
- Mixing rounded and sharp corners on the same page
- Red/accent used for decoration or large areas (< 5% surface only)

## Design Tokens (Summary)

Full specs in `references/design-tokens.md`. Key rules:

- **Typography**: Modular scale (ratio 1.25). Max 2 font families. Never use Inter/Roboto/Open Sans/Poppins.
- **Spacing**: 8px base grid. Section padding: 80-128px vertical. More space = more premium.
- **Color**: Monochrom-warm + one chromatic accent. Three neutral axes (black, silver, brown) + accent.
- **Border-radius**: One personality per project (sharp/soft/round). No mixing.
- **Shadows**: Dark mode uses border+bg elevation. Light mode uses warm-tinted layered shadows.

## CRO Architecture

Conversion hierarchy for every B2B page:

1. **HERO** — Capture attention, state value (5-8 sec window)
2. **PROOF** — Remove doubt (logos, stats, case study teaser)
3. **MECHANISM** — Show how it works (3-step process)
4. **OFFER** — Define what they get
5. **OBJECTION** — Handle resistance (FAQ)
6. **FINAL CTA** — Last chance with clarity

### CRO Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- One primary CTA per page. Repeat it, don't compete with it.
- CTA must be highest-contrast element. Min 7:1 against background.
- Above-fold: headline, sub-headline, primary CTA, one trust signal.
- Form fields: max 3 for first contact.
- Negative space around CTA: min 48px padding.
- Mobile: sticky CTA after scroll past hero.
- Page interactive in <2.5s.

## Motion (Summary)

Full specs in `references/motion.md`. Core rules:

- Every animation needs a functional purpose. No decoration.
- Total animation budget per page load: < 2 seconds cumulative.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- CSS + Intersection Observer only. No React/GSAP. <50KB JS for animations.

## WordPress / Blocksy Notes

- Base theme: Blocksy. Custom CSS via Customizer or child theme.
- Custom JS: `wp_enqueue_script` with `defer`. Never inline.
- No Elementor/Divi. Gutenberg blocks + custom CSS.

### Performance Budgets

|--------|--------|------------|
| LCP | < 1.5s | < 2.5s |
| INP | < 100ms | < 200ms |

| Total Weight | < 800KB | < 1.5MB |
| JS Bundle | < 100KB | < 200KB |
| Web Fonts | 2 weights | 3 weights |
