echo "1. Extract repeated UI render blocks instead of widening seo-cockpit-ui.php."
echo "2. Keep internal link counting normalized to the same URL model as the cockpit."
echo "3. Treat Koko as traffic context, not a replacement for Search Console."
echo "4. Add paging and caps deliberately, not by inflating row limits."
echo "5. Add small runtime diagnostics for OAuth, cron, and drilldown stability."
